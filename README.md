### Register No.: 212222110049
### Date: 

## Aim:
To develop a prompt-based application tailored to personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

## AI Tools Required:
•	Text Assistance: ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek
•	Video Generation: Runway
•	Image Generation: Midjourney

## Prompt:
"Design a smart engineering assistant that can help mechanical engineering students manage their study schedules, provide explanations of technical concepts, simulate viva questions, and offer quick revision summaries. The assistant should interact using natural language and adapt to the user's academic focus."

## Procedure:
### Step 1: Define User Needs
•	Organizing academic schedules and deadlines

•	Clarifying engineering topics (e.g., thermodynamics, manufacturing)

•	Preparing for viva exams

•	Quick recaps of difficult topics before tests

Selected Use Case: Smart Study Planner for Mechanical Engineering Students

### Step 2: Simple Prompt Design
Basic Prompt:
“Help me plan today’s study schedule: revise thermodynamics, complete CAD assignment, and review gear trains.”

Expected Output:

•	Ordered list of tasks with equal time split

•	Simple layout for morning, afternoon, and evening study

### Step 3: Intermediate Prompting (Topic Categorization)
Prompt:
“Categorize the following tasks into Theory, Practical, and Assignment. Suggest ideal time slots and durations.”
Tasks: Revise thermodynamics, Complete CAD assignment, Review gear trains, Watch video on CAM, Solve kinematics problems.

Expected Output:
•	Theory: Thermodynamics, Gear Trains – 1 hour each

•	Practical: CAD, CAM Video – 1.5 hours each

•	Assignment: Kinematics problems – 2 hours

### Step 4: Advanced Prompting with Custom Preferences
Prompt:
“Act as my engineering study assistant. Based on my focus time in the morning and creative energy in the afternoon, create a personalized schedule from 9 AM to 6 PM. Include short breaks, motivational quotes before difficult topics, and mix theory with practical work.”

Expected Output:

•	9:00–10:30 AM: Thermodynamics revision (Quote: "Master the basics to conquer the complex")

•	10:30–11:00 AM: Break

•	11:00–12:30 PM: Solve kinematics problems

•	12:30–1:30 PM: Lunch

•	1:30–3:00 PM: CAD Assignment

•	3:00–3:15 PM: Break

•	3:15–4:15 PM: Gear Train Review

•	4:15–5:30 PM: CAM Video

•	5:30–6:00 PM: Light recap session

### Step 5: Smart Features via Prompt Expansion
Prompt:
“Based on my learning goal (preparing for a mechanical engineering viva), create a day plan that includes technical concept reviews, viva simulation, and stress-busting activities. Include question samples and suggest confidence-building techniques.”

Expected Output:

•	Review topics: Thermodynamics laws, Lathe operations, Types of gears

•	Simulated Questions: “Explain 2nd law of thermodynamics,” “What is backlash in gears?”

•	Techniques: Practice deep breathing before starting, break long topics into smaller units, end with a success reflection

### Step 6: Advanced Prompt Template for Daily Use
Reusable Prompt Template:
“Based on my usual routine, generate a balanced study plan using the following tasks: [list]. Include motivational tips and adjust based on time availability.”

Benefits:

•	Encourages daily use

•	Builds structure for exam preparation

•	Simulates intelligent assistant behavior for learning

# Implementation Ideas:
•	Python notebook using ChatGPT API

•	Mobile or web-based UI using no-code tools (Bubble, Glide)

•	Simple Telegram bot connected to LLM

# Conclusion:
This experiment shows how prompt engineering can be applied creatively to build study assistants for engineering students. Starting from simple prompts and advancing to complex, preference-based scheduling, the application helps learners manage their time, recall critical concepts, and feel supported during exam preparation. It demonstrates how language models can adapt to real-world academic use cases.

# Result:
The prompts were successfully designed and executed. The resulting prompt-based assistant helped structure the academic workflow for mechanical engineering students, improved content recall, and simulated smart assistant behavior using ChatGPT and related AI tools.
